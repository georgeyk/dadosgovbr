The\\n    ``count`` field contains the total number of Resources found without the\\n    limit or query parameters having an effect.  The ``results`` field is a\\n    list of dictized Resource objects.\\n\\n    The 'query' parameter is a required field.  It is a string of the form\\n    ``{field}:{term}`` or a list of strings, each of the same form.  Within\\n    each string, ``{field}`` is a field or extra field on the Resource domain\\n    object.\\n\\n    If ``{field}`` is ``\\\"hash\\\"``, then an attempt is made to match the\\n    `{term}` as a *prefix* of the ``Resource.hash`` field.\\n\\n    If ``{field}`` is an extra field, then an attempt is made to match against\\n    the extra fields stored against the Resource.\\n\\n    Note: The search is limited to search against extra fields declared in\\n    the config setting ``ckan.extra_resource_fields``.\\n\\n    Note: Due to a Resource's extra fields being stored as a json blob, the\\n    match is made against the json string representation.  As such, false\\n    positives may occur:\\n\\n    If the search criteria is: ::\\n\\n        query = \\\"field1:term1\\\"\\n\\n    Then a json blob with the string representation of: ::\\n\\n        {\\\"field1\\\": \\\"foo\\\", \\\"field2\\\": \\\"term1\\\"}\\n\\n    will match the search criteria!  This is a known short-coming of this\\n    approach.\\n\\n    All matches are made ignoring case; and apart from the ``\\\"hash\\\"`` field,\\n    a term matches if it is a substring of the field's value.\\n\\n    Finally, when specifying more than one search criteria, the criteria are\\n    AND-ed together.\\n\\n    The ``order`` parameter is used to control the ordering of the results.\\n    Currently only ordering one field is available, and in ascending order\\n    only.\\n\\n    The ``fields`` parameter is deprecated as it is not compatible with calling\\n    this action with a GET request to the action API.\\n\\n    The context may contain a flag, `search_query`, which if True will make\\n    this action behave as if being used by the internal search api.  ie - the\\n    results will not be dictized, and SearchErrors are thrown for bad search\\n    queries (rather than ValidationErrors).\\n\\n    :param query: The search criteria.  See above for description.\\n    :type query: string or list of strings of the form \\\"{field}:{term1}\\\"\\n    :param fields: Deprecated\\n    :type fields: dict of fields to search terms.\\n    :param order_by: A field on the Resource model that orders the results.\\n    :type order_by: string\\n    :param offset: Apply an offset to the query.\\n    :type offset: int\\n    :param limit: Apply a limit to the query.\\n    :type limit: int\\n\\n    :returns:  A dictionary with a ``count`` field, and a ``results`` field.\\n    :rtype: dict\\n\\n    \", \"success\": true, \"result\": {\"count\": 0, \"results\": []}}"
